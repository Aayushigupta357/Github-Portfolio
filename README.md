# About

Hi, I'm Aayushi! I have an analytical background in Travel and hospitality and currently, i am on track to completing my degree in Data Science (MBA - Distance). I have developed a strong foundation in life science and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data specialist. 

During my previous projects, I have handled complex dat and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in data processing techniques, statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist. 

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

This isa repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
