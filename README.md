# Aayushi Gupta - Data Analyst Portfolio

# About

Hi, I'm Aayushi! I have an analytical background in Travel and hospitality and currently, I am on track to completing my degree in Data Science (MBA - Distance). I have developed a strong foundation in life science and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data specialist. 

During my previous projects, I have handled complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in data processing techniques, statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist. 

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
